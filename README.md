A [libcluon](https://github.com/chrberger/libcluon)-based microservice for eavesdropping on a NMEA0183 stream over (UDP). This software does not perform any parsing of the NMEA sentences, merely assembles any fragmented messages into full sentences. It can be run in two modes:
* `gather`, connect to an UDP stream of incoming NMEA0183 sentences and either:
  * publish to an OD4 session, or
  * log directly to disk (`--standalone`)
* `log`, listen to an OD4 session for raw NMEA0183 messages from other `gatherers`  and dump these to an aggregated log file on disk

## How do I get it?
Each release of `cluon-nmea0183` is published as a docker image [here](https://github.com/orgs/RISE-MO/packages/container/package/cluon-nmea0183) and is publicly available.

Can also be used as a standalone commandline tool. No pre-built binaries are, however, provided for this purpose.

## Example docker-compose setup
The example below showcases a setup with two gatherers (listening on two separate UDP streams) and one logger that aggregates published messages from the gatherers into a single file.
```yaml
version: '2'
services:    
    gatherer_1:
        container_name: cluon-nmea0183-gatherer-1
        image: ghcr.io/rise-mo/cluon-nmea0183:v0.1.0
        restart: on-failure
        network_mode: "host"
        command: "--cid 111 --id 1 gather -a 255.255.255.255 -p 1456"
    gatherer_2:
        container_name: cluon-nmea0183-gatherer-2
        image: ghcr.io/rise-mo/cluon-nmea0183:v0.1.0
        restart: on-failure
        network_mode: "host"
        command: "--cid 111 --id 2 gather -a 239.192.0.3 -p 60003"
    logger:
        container_name: cluon-nmea0183-logger
        image: ghcr.io/rise-mo/cluon-nmea0183:v0.1.0
        restart: on-failure
        network_mode: "host"
        volumes:
        - .:/opt/cluon-nmea0183
        command: "--cid 111 --path /opt/cluon-nmea0183/recordings/record.log log"
```

## Details

### Message set
This microservice introduce a new OD4-compatible message type (`raw.NMEA0183`) in the `risemo` message set. See `src/risemo-message-set.odvd` for details.

### Build from source
This repository makes use of [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) for dependency resolution as an interal part of the CMake setup. As a result, the only requirements for building from source are:
* a C++17 compliant compiler
* CMake (>=3.14)

As part of the CMake configuration step, the following dependencies are downloaded and configured:
* [libcluon](https://github.com/chrberger/libcluon)
* [CLI11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11)
* [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
* [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) (for testing only)

To build (from the root directory of this repo):
```cmd
cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -- -j 8
```

### Tests

Unit tests for the NMEA01843 sentence assembler is compiled into the executable `cluon-nmea0183-tester`.

To run tests (after successful build):
```cmd
cd build
ctest -C Debug -T test --output-on-failure --
```

A simple integration test can also be done by running the compiled commandline tool (cluon-nmea0183) in conjunction with the provided python script `fake_nmea_0183_stream_udp.py` in the `tests` folder.
